# Style-Transfer-Using-Mask-Main
Neural style transfer app that selectively applies artistic style using a binary mask â€” built with PyTorch and Gradio.

# ðŸŽ¨ Style Transfer Using Mask (VGG16 + PyTorch + Gradio)

This project performs **masked neural style transfer**, allowing you to apply an artistic style to **selected regions** of a content image using a binary mask. Built using **PyTorch**, a **pretrained VGG16** model, and a **Gradio web interface** for easy interaction.
